== asciinema-tool

This python script allows you to manipulate asciinema cast files.

It takes and imput cast file, manipulates it and sends the output to stdout.

Currently the script provides only four functions:

Print the frame deltas.

Add a delay into the cast.

Cut frames from the cast.

Change the deltas between a set of frames.




=== Printing Deltas between frames

Printing deltas between the frames allso prints the frame numbers.

=== Adding a Delay

Delays are added


=== Cutting frames
